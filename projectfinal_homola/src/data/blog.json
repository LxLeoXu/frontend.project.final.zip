      "content": "The Radeon RX 9070 XT is a graphics card by AMD, expected to launch on January 24, 2025. Built on the 4 nm process and based on the Navi 48 graphics processor (Navi 48 XT variant), the card supports DirectX 12 Ultimate. This ensures that all modern games will run on the Radeon RX 9070 XT. Additionally, the DirectX 12 Ultimate capability guarantees support for hardware-raytracing, variable-rate shading, and more in upcoming video games. It features 4096 shading units, 256 texture mapping units, and 96 ROPs. The card also has 64 raytracing acceleration cores. AMD has paired 16 GB of GDDR6 memory with the Radeon RX 9070 XT, connected using a 256-bit memory interface. The GPU operates at a frequency of 2400 MHz, which can be boosted up to 2970 MHz, with memory running at 2438 MHz (19.5 Gbps effective). Being a dual-slot card, the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT draws power from 2x 8-pin power connectors, with power draw rated at a maximum of 260 W. Display outputs include 1x HDMI 2.1a and 3x DisplayPort 2.1. The Radeon RX 9070 XT is connected to the rest of the system using a PCI-Express 4.0 x16 interface. The card's dimensions are 267 mm x 111 mm x 50 mm, and it features a dual-slot cooling solution.",

      "content": "an 16 (Reuters) - J.P.Morgan estimated spending on data centers could contribute between 10-20 basis points to U.S. economic growth in 2025-2026 as technology companies race to benefit from the artificial intelligence boom.Investments in data centers, which help provide computing power for AI, have surged since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2022, as companies across sectors increasingly shift their operations to the cloud and integrate AI into their offerings.Advertisement · Scroll to continue Mega-cap cloud companies including Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab have been heavily spending on AI-related investments. The boost to gross domestic product (GDP) could primarily come through demand for data center construction, technology equipment investment, and for additional power generation and transmission infrastructure, the Wall Street brokerage said in a note dated Wednesday. Spending on data centers likely contributed 0.1%-0.3% to GDP growth in 2024, as per J.P.Morgan's estimates. While the brokerage estimates exclude the costs of new power generation, it projected each 5-10 gigawatt in new capacity could require $20 billion in spending, or 7 basis points of GDP. U.S. power consumption will rise to record highs in 2025 and 2026, the government's Energy Information Administration said in its Short Term Energy Outlook (STEO) on Tuesday. There has been help from the political front too, as President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Tuesday to provide federal support to address massive energy needs for fast-growing advanced AI data centers.",
